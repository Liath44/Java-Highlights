# Java-Highlights

While the projects found in this repository may not be all that impressive their goal is to show that I can indeed programme in Java (+ JUnit) and quite aesthetically at that (clean code, consistency with conventions and all that jazz)

Short descriptions of projects:
 - HeapSort: Implementetions of Heap Sort, Insertion Sort and Quick Sort + JUnit tests
 - RedBlackTree: Implementation of RedBlackTree + JUnit tests (with RedBlackTreeVerifier and tests for it)
 - SortComparison: Sorting algorithms from previous projects along with simple utilities for time measurements
 - JVac: Simple project for max. value && min. cost problem (details can be found in documentation attached). Implements Simplex method with mixed constraints.
